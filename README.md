This is my workflow reading through the Complex Surveys: A Guide to
Analysis Using R book by Thomas Lumley.

  - [Chapter 1 - Basic
    Tools](https://github.com/tomasokal/complex_surveys/blob/master/Chapter-1-Basic-Tools.md)
  - [Chapter 2 - Simple and Stratified
    Sampling](https://github.com/tomasokal/complex_surveys/blob/master/Chapter-2-Simple-and-Stratified-Sampling.md)
